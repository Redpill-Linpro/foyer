Introduction
============

As of writing the Foyer application is a pretty small Rails application. It
uses a plugin called 'admin_data' to create an interface that administrators
can access through a link on the frontpage. Main concepts are **Users**,
**Customers**, **Portlets** (and also **Roles**) and the relations
between these.

**Users** are people who can log into the application. Each user is
associated with a **Role** which is used to decide access rules. So far there
are only normal users and administrators, where administrators have access to
the admin interface and normal users not.

**Customers** are different companies. A user is associated with one or more
customers, which gives the user access to the information gathered for that
customer.

The information available for each customer is decided by the different
**Portlets** that are associated with them. Each portlet exposes some new
information about a customer.
